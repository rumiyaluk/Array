Task
Split the string into separate letters
Write a splitString function that takes str as an argument and returns an array containing the letters of that string. Use a row loop and push method in your solution. The split () method is not allowed in this task.
Example:
• the splitString ("Monkey") function must return ["M", "o", "n", "k", "e", "y"];
• the splitString ([]) function must return [].

Solution
function splitString (str) {
  let arr = Array.from (str);
  return arr;
}
