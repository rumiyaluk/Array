Task
New array and deleted element. Removing the last element.
Write a function deleteFromEnd that takes the arr array as an argument, removes the last element of the array, and returns the resulting array and the deleted element as an array [newArray, element].
Example:
• the deleteFromEnd ([1, 2, 3]) function must return [[1, 2], 3];
• the deleteFromEnd ([1]) function must return [[], 1];
• the deleteFromEnd ([]) function must return [[], undefined].


Solution
function deleteFromEnd (arr) {
let n = arr.pop ();
return [arr, n];
}
