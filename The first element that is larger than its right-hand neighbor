Task
The first element that is larger than its right-hand neighbor
Write a function firstBigger that takes a numeric array arr as an argument and returns the first element of the array that is larger than its right-hand neighbor, or undefined if the array is in ascending order.
Examples:
• the firstBigger ([0, 8, 4, 1]) function must return 8 (since 8> 4 is the first element of the array, which is greater than the element following it);
• the firstBigger ([1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 15]) function must return undefined (since the elements are in ascending order, the array does not contain an element that is greater than the element following it);
• the firstBigger ([]) function must return undefined.

Solution
function firstBigger (arr) {
  for (let i = 0; i <arr.length; i ++) {
   if (arr [i]> arr [i + 1]) {
   return arr [i];
  }
  }
return undefined;
}
