Task
Two girlfriends went to the forest to pick mushrooms, and after collecting them, they decided to count who had collected the most.
The first friend counted 20 mushrooms in her basket, and the second 23.
Create two variables firstCart and secondCart and assign them the corresponding values ​​20 and 23.
Create a third variable trueOrFalse and check: is it true that the second friend picked more mushrooms?
Let's give an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
const deckOfCardsForPoker = 52;
const deckOfCardsForJass = 36;
const trueOrFalse = deckOfCardsForPoker <deckOfCardsForJass; // false

Solution
const firstCart = 20;
const secondCart = 23;
const trueOrFalse = firstCart <secondCart;
