Task

Number of goals scored
The football team took part in several games of the football season.
The array stores information about the number of goals scored by each player in different games.
For example, [[1, 3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 1], [2, 4], ..., [2, 1, 1]].
If a player has not scored a single goal, then there is no information about his goals in the array. Those. there is no element [0] in the array. It is required to determine the total number of goals scored by the football team during the season.
Write a function sumOfGoals that takes an array arr, stores the number of goals scored by each player in different games, and returns the total number of goals scored by a football team.
Use a loop in your solution. Array methods are not allowed.
Example:
• function sumOfGoals ([[2, 2], [3, 2, 1], [4, 3, 3]]) should return 20.

Solution
function sumOfGoals (arr) {
 пусть totalSum = 0;
  for (let el of arr) {
      пусть сумма = 0;
      for (let elem of el) {
          сумма = сумма + элемент;
     }
       totalSum + = сумма;
  }
  return totalSum;
}
