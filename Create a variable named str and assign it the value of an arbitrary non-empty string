Task
Create a variable named str and assign it the value of an arbitrary non-empty string. 
Create a variable firstSymbol and assign it the value of the first character of the string.
Create a variable named isStartWithA and assign it the result of comparing the first character of the string with 'A',
i.e. the variable isStartWithA will be true if the string starts with 'A' and false otherwise.
 Solution
const str = 'Anna';
const firstSymbol = str [0];
const isStartWithA = firstSymbol === 'A';
